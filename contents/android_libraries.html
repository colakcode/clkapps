          <p class="text-secondary">For the last few years, I have been using tools made with canvas method
                                   in android applications that I have made as an amateur. I wanted to reshape
                                   these tools in a customizable way and make them available to friends who have
                                   just started developing android applications. I wanted to contribute to open
                                   source softwares that I learned a lot in this way. I have been sharing the android
                                   libraries that I have written in java for a short time via GitHub. These libraries;
                                   a pie and donut chart method for your need to graph your data in your application,
                                   a customizable circular progress and a dialog window where you can give the user
                                   simple choices.</p>  
                                   
          <p class="text-secondary">I love working with canvas ever since I started programming android applications with Java.
                                   I think it is a difficult but enjoyable subject to master screen pixels using mathematics and to create your
                                   own animations and visual tools. I would like to mention once again that I have a different profession and I 
                                   am amateurly interested in android application development. For this reason, I always care about bugs and
                                   suggestions in libraries. Please contact info@colakcode.com about the issues you want to fix or add to the
                                   my libraries in GitHub. I'm waiting for your mails. Stay well ..</p>
